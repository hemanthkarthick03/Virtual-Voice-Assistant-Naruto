# Virtual Voice Assistant with Hand Gesture Control

The Python Code allows the end-user to communicate with a desktop computer by voice and it also responds to the voice instructions given by the user. The assistant is designed in such a way, that it takes the user input in the form of verbal commands and displays the input and processes it, and returns the output in various forms, like action to be performed or the verbal result is dictated to the end-user.

Text to speech is a way of transforming a response to convey what was done if an action was taken or to show that it did not understand. Text to speech (TTS) has a variety of options. There are several non-AI alternatives available, like speech_recognition, gTTS and much more.

Voice Assistant helps with accessing and browsing webpages like Gmail, YouTube, The Times of India, and Google. It also plays a song at the user's instruction. The voice bot can access the system camera and take pictures and videos, up on the user's instructions. Handling system brightness and volume on user's hand gestures, which are recognized using the camera, are some highlights of the Assistant. 

On the whole, the virtual voice assistant is a bot which helps the user to handle all tasks on the system using verbal directives and reduces manual actions.

This can be directly be implemented in the personal computers and can be analyzed and tested in real-time.
